		 <h3>FIGHTER OF THE DESTINY</h3>
		 <p><strong>Tianji Tower, the leading organisation of the pugilistic world (jianghu) is determined to overthrow Liu Ziye, the tyrannical ruler of the Liu Song dynasty. To achieve their mission, Tianji Tower replaces his sister Liu Chuyu with their own disciple and Princess-lookalike Zhu Que. Zhu Que meets the Princess’ learned companion Rong Zhi, who turns out to be a spy from Northern Wei. 
Liu Chuyu and Rong Zhi’s relationship eventually breaks down overmisunderstandings and differing loyalties, and the latter fakes his death in order to regain Chuyu’s forgiveness. Then Liu Chuyu as her memories erased by imperial astrologer and Rong Zhi gets his mind wiped. They meet five years later when Chuyu is sent to marry Northern Wei’s Prince regent, who is none other than the now Rong Zhi.
