		 <h3>CINDERELLA AND FOUR NIGHTS</h3>
		 <p><strong>  
		Eun Ha Won is in the third grade of high school. She hopes to become a teacher which her late mother always wished for. Ha Won has a bright personality and a strong set of morals, but she is unhappy at home. She's unattached from her father, step-mother, and step-sister and also mistreated. Ha-Won works various part-time jobs to pay for her upcoming university tuition fees. She knows she needs to make more money to pay for the storage of her mother's ashes at the cemetery. Her mother's ashes were recently removed because of unpaid bills.
Meanwhile, Ji Woon , Hyun Min and Seo Woo are spoiled cousins and live together in the mansion Sky House. With their different personalities - Ji Woon is a tough guy, Hyun Min is a playboy and Seo Woo is a musician - they don't like each other at all. Additionally, Ji Woon likes Hye Ji who likes Hyun Min.
One day, their grandfather orders his 3 grandsons to attend his 5th wedding ceremony. Hyun Min doesn't want to go, but he hires Ha Won for 3 hours and takes her to his grandfather's wedding ceremony. His plan is to upstage his grandfather's wedding ceremony with the surprise appearance of Ha Won. There, the grandfather witnesses Ha Won's no-nonsense attitude towards Hyun Min and decides to hire her as a live-in butler at the Sky House. He hopes she is able to change the ways of his grandsons.
